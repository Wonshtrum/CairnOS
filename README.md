# CairnOS
CairnOS is a basic operating system built from the Youtube tutorial channel [Write your own Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQdZltW7bh1ta-_nCH7LWYw).

It is not designed to be good for anything, but rather to allow me to get a first experience in this field before starting a more serious project.
